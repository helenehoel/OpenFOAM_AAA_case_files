# OpenFOAM_AAA_case_files
This repository contains the full OpenFOAM setup necessary to reproduce the simulations performed as part of my Master's thesis.

The custom boundary condition, threeElementWindkessel, is largely based on code developed by M. Raza. His original implementation and documentation can be found in his project report: https://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2024/MuhammadAhmadRaza/OSCFD2024_ProjectReport_MARaza.pdf
